#CODE STARTS HERE##

import speech_recognition as hp   #pip install SpeechRecognition and import the library
s=hp.Recognizer()
with hp.Microphone() as user_input:  #using the inbuilt microphone of the device
    print('speak into the microphone:\n') #asking the user to input the data
    aud=s.listen(user_input) 
    try:
        out=s.recognize_google(aud)
        print('Did you mean to say:{}'.format(out))
    except:
        print('could not understand please repeat into the mic again')
